# React Hooks
#### React Hooks are a set of functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. Prior to the introduction of Hooks in React 16.8, state management and lifecycle methods were only available in class components. With Hooks, you can now use these features in functional components as well, making them more powerful and flexible.

# Some of the most commonly used Hooks are:
<ul>
  <li><h4>UseState<h4/> : Allows you to add state to your functional components. The useState Hook returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update the state.</li>
  <br/>
  <li>UseEffect: Allows you to perform side effects in your components, such as fetching data or subscribing to events. The useEffect Hook takes a function as its argument, which will be called after every render.</li>
   <br/>
  <li>UseContext: Allows you to access context in your components. Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.</li>
   <br/>
  <li>UseReducer: Allows you to manage complex state in your components. The useReducer Hook takes a reducer function and an initial state value as its arguments, and returns the current state value and a dispatch function.
</li>
   <br/>
  <li>UseCallback: Allows you to memoize functions in your components. This can be useful for optimizing performance in components that rely on expensive calculations or data fetching.</li>

  <li>UseMemo: Allows you to memoize values in your components. This can be useful for optimizing performance in components that rely on expensive calculations or data fetching.</li>
</ul>
