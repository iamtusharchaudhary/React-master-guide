# Create Your Local JSON Server
<ul>
  <li>JSON Server is a lightweight server that allows you to quickly create a REST API with a JSON file as a data source. It's useful for prototyping and front-end development, as it allows you to quickly create a fake API to work with before the real one is ready.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>With JSON Server, you can create a server that serves static JSON data by creating a JSON file that contains your data and running the server with the json-server command. JSON Server will automatically create a REST API based on the data in your JSON file, with support for pagination, filtering, sorting, and more.</li>
</ul>
