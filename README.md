React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces and it is a tool for building UI components and it is used to build single-page applications.
React allows us to create reusable UI components.
React is a framework that employs Webpack to automatically compile React, JSX, and ES6 code while handling CSS file prefixes. React is a JavaScript-based UI development library. Although React is a library rather than a language, it is widely used in web development. The library first appeared in May 2013 and is now one of the most commonly used frontend libraries for web development.

> Components : React is built around the concept of components which are self-contained UI elements that can be reused throughout your app.

> Virtual DOM : React uses a virtual representation of the DOM, which is more efficient than directly manipulating the actual DOM.

> State management : React provides a way to manage state with in components, which makes it easier to build complex UIs.

> JSX : React uses a syntax extension called JSX, which allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript files.
